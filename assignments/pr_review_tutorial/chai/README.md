The simple_functions package includes several common and helpful mathematic series and functions. Here's an example of using a factorial function to find the value of 10!:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    3628800

The fibonacci function will display the fibonacci series up to a given value. If a number in the fibonacci series is greater than the input value, the array will not include it and the result will be displayed:

    >>> fibonacci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
